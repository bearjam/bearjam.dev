A website's navigation interface is a fundamental part of the user experience.
As a web developer or designer, you'll be creating headers, footers, sidebars
etc. for most projects. You want to spend more time creating a unique site for
your client, and less time re-implementing the same feature.

Let's get straight into a code example to get a sense of what we're dealing
with. Here's a similar header to the one we use for [the bearjam.dev site](/):

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/mysterybear/blog-post-demos/tree/master/packages/header-full" />

Now let's break down what it does.

## Feature Requirements

- It's **responsive**: the header adapts to changes in screen size (specifically
  at 640px width breakpoint, try dragging the view narrower).
- When the screen width is below the breakpoint, **there is a toggle menu to
  expand/collapse the mobile header**.
- When the screen width is 640px or greater, the navigation links are displayed
  horizontally on the desktop header.
- When the mobile header is expanded, there's a **staggered animation** to bring
  the links into view (and this effect is reversed upon collapse).
- **The active link indication is different between mobile and desktop**: on
  mobile, the active link text colour is blue; on desktop, the active link has a
  blue underline.
- When clicking the desktop header links, **the blue underline transitions
  between links**.

At first glance, the main problem may appear to be figuring out all these
animations, but luckily there's
[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/)[^1], which makes declaring
each of these animations almost boringly simple!

We found the biggest problem was to keep our code clean and readble, to abide by
the DRY principle, as we worked through these requirements.

We identified two well-known patterns that fit well together to bring all this
together.

_Note: We use [Next](https://nextjs.org/) in the example code here. For
[bearjam.dev](/) we use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) which in turn uses
[Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router). You could also use
[React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)._

## #1 The Overlay Pattern

Taking elements out of flow to put them on top of others, using
[positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning),
is standard practice for web developers. But keeping things readable and easy to
reason about can get tricky when you've got lots of nested div's. We found that
thinking explicitly in terms of "Root > Backdrop + Container" (to write in
selector form) really simplifies matters. Think of it this way:

```jsx
<Root animate={variant}>
  <Backdrop />
  <Container>{children}</Container>
</Root>
```

- `<Root />`'s responsibility is to cascade the animation state down through its
  children.
- The `<Backdrop />` is the expand/collapse-able pane, the underlay.
- The `<Container />` is where the rest of the content goes, e.g. your
  `<Nav />`('s).

Here's an example header component using this pattern:

```jsx
function Header() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  const toggleOpen = () => void setOpen(p => !p)
  return (
    <Root animate={open ? "open" : "closed"} initial="closed">
      <Backdrop
        variants={{
          closed: {
            y: `calc(-100% + ${theme.spacing[12]})`,
          },
          open: {
            y: 0,
          },
        }}
        transition={{
          type: "spring",
          damping: 25,
          mass: 0.9,
          stiffness: 120,
        }}
      />
      <Container>
        <MenuToggle onClick={toggleOpen} />
      </Container>
    </Root>
  )
}
```

Styled as follows:

```css
.backdrop {
  background-color: lightpink;
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  z-index: 10;
}

.container {
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: theme("spacing.12");
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  z-index: 20;
}

.container > * {
  padding: 0.5rem;
}
```

[Here's a CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/mysterybear/blog-post-demos/tree/master/packages/header-pattern-1),
notice how simple it is to change it to a `<Sidebar />`. This solves the first
couple of points in the [feature requirements above](#feature-requirements).

## #2 The Render Props Pattern

Now how about the issue of us having two different navigation sub-tree's, one
for mobile one for desktop? On the [bearjam.dev](/) site we even re-use this
again in the footer!

This is a great time to leverage the
[render props pattern](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html). As mentioned
[here](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html#using-props-other-than-render),
you can use the `children` prop, and in our use case here, in terms of
[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), it's a godsend!

Before we get into its implementation, let's look at how we call it:

<div class="lowlight">

```jsx{6-44,48-57}
<Container>
  <Branding />
  <MenuToggle onClick={toggleOpen} className={styles.menu} />
  <AnimatePresence>
    {open && (
      <Nav
        className={styles.navMobile}
        variants={{
          open: {
            transition: {
              staggerChildren: 0.3,
              delayChildren: 0.3,
            },
          },
          closed: {
            transition: {
              staggerChildren: 0.3,
              staggerDirection: -1,
            },
          },
        }}
        initial="closed"
        animate="open"
        exit="closed"
      >
        {({ href, label, active }) => (
          <motion.div
            initial="closed"
            variants={{
              open: {
                opacity: 1,
              },
              closed: {
                opacity: 0,
              },
            }}
            onClick={() => void setOpen(false)}
          >
            <Link href={href}>
              <a data-active={active}>{label}</a>
            </Link>
          </motion.div>
        )}
      </Nav>
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
  <AnimateSharedLayout>
    <Nav className={styles.navDesktop}>
      {({ href, label, active }) => (
        <Link href={href}>
          <a>
            <span>{label}</span>
            {active && <motion.div layoutId="underline" />}
          </a>
        </Link>
      )}
    </Nav>
  </AnimateSharedLayout>
</Container>
```

</div>

Notice how we pass a function as the child of each `<Nav />`. Magically:

- We have access to `href`, `label` and `active` as function input parameters
- This one function is mapped across all of our links

All that magic is hidden in the implementation of our `<Nav />`:

```jsx
export const Nav = ({ children, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <motion.nav {...props}>
      {links.map((linkProps, i) => (
        <NavLink
          key={linkProps.href}
          children={children}
          {...linkProps}
          i={i}
        />
      ))}
    </motion.nav>
  )
}

const NavLink = ({ children, href, label, i, ...props }) => {
  const { pathname } = useRouter()
  const pathBeginning = `/${pathname.split("/")[1]}`
  const active = pathBeginning === href
  return children ? (
    children({ href, label, active, ...props }, i)
  ) : (
    <Link key={href} href={href} {...props}>
      <a>{label}</a>
    </Link>
  )
}

const links = [
  { href: "/", label: "Page One" },
  { href: "/page-two", label: "Page Two" },
]
```

Notice how our `<Nav />` passes our `children` function into the function
mapping over our links.

We also provide a default return in case `children` is undefined, allowing us to
actually just call `<Nav />` on its own without any children and still get a
fully functional navigation with links if we don't need to do any fancy active
link animation (as is the case in the [bearjam.dev](/) footer).

Well, that's that then! Until next time!

### Footnotes

[^1]:
  There's also [React Spring](http://react-spring.io/) but we'll use the former
  in our code here.
