## Questions

### Set the scene

- What's the difference between a header and a nav?
- Should I use the same header for mobile and desktop?
- What should I include in the header?
- What makes a good header?
- How is a header/nav different in React/Gatsby?
- ~~Why do I need a header?~~

### Baby steps

- Where do I start with making a header?
- How do I link to internal pages with Gatsby?

### Styling

- How can I show which page the user is currently on?
- How do I make the menu icon transition to an X on mobile?

## Answers

- Same header for mobile and desktop? Re-use where possible!

Semantically, a header
[_"represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids"_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header).
Navigation + branding, basically. Also, to me, header implies at the TOP! For a
sidebar, use `<aside>`. `<footer>` for bottom.

The nav's purpose is
[_"purpose is to provide navigation links"_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav).

This is more a question of structure, in terms of HTML and CSS. We use Gatsby
(and therefore React), however, these concepts are somewhat
language/framework-agnostic.

### Assumptions

- This is responsive, for mobile and desktop (this is a core requirement)

### Questi-questions

How can I write my header/nav such that it is as X, Y, Z as possible (re-usable,
general, works for mobile/desktop but customizable too).

It's always something in between perfect abstraction and disposable mess.

## Intro

A preparedness to re-visit first principles. Baby steps.

## Key Points

- If element is positioned (absolute, fixed, sticky), mx-auto only works if left
  and right are 0 (tailwind rule inset-x-0)
