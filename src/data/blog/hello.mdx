Today is the launch of our shiny new website. Launching a website is a bit like
celebrating an anniversary, the first day that the venture is presented to the
world. But before Bearjam became an official entity, we were just Magda and Tom.

When we met, we knew we’d make things together. One of us could engineer systems
in code but could barely draw a straight line; the other had an eye for
composition but had never written a ‘Hello World!’ program.

We spent months travelling, learning, sketching, coding and collaborating before
idea clouds became clear. The world is full of creative and clever people, with
wonderful ideas and initiatives. It should be easy to get them online, with a
unique website that enriches their community.

Good people deserve a place on the web, and the internet deserves good websites.
This is where Bearjam begins. We build robust websites and create custom designs
to suit your unique story.

Welcome to the start of our journey. We’ll be sharing what we learn on this blog
and as our business grows, our website will grow too.

To start your journey with us, [get in touch](/contact).
