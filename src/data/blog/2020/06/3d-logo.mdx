If you sign up to the bearjam.dev mailing list, you'll see this a 3D version of
our logo spinning around as a loading indicator:

This was my first 3D project, I had wondered how to get my feet wet. This seemed
like really low-hanging fruit. I'd looked at the R3F demos and how easy it was
to spring-animate something. So all I needed to do was make a box, stick our B
on it, and then spring animate it. I could fade it in/out.

First things first, I basically did this with vanilla Three code without R3F.
I'd definitely recommend that before using R3F, despite R3F's nicer declarative
syntax (it's just good to get an understanding of the underlying API).

Check links for Three fundamentals, especially cameras, helpers, controls.

R3F is a react reconciler, see Henschel's conference talk.

This means it can transform JSX tags, check out here for the mappings between
R3F and Three:

## Animating

we use react-spring as per the recipe here

https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber/blob/master/recipes.md

but in our site we use Framer Motion's useSpring since we already are using that
lib.

## Performance, Look at the Lighthouse Audit!

## React Intersection Observer?
