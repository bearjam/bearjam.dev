When you sign up to the bearjam.dev mailing list, you will see a 3D loading
spinner. Here it is in isolation:

**first spinner 3d demo**

We needed something to indicate the loading state during subscription, and I was
also keen to get my feet wet in the 3D web space, so ... two birds one stone.

Looking at the
[react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) (R3F)
demos and how little code is needed to spin a box, it seemed like the ideal
entry-level 3D project (especially suiting our isometric cube logo!)

However, R3F didn't actually make much sense to me until I'd coded a basic
vanilla Three.js example. **I strongly recommend starting with vanilla Three.js
code** before porting to R3F in order to understand the underlying API.

Here are the resources that got me going with Three.js and R3F.

## Resources

### Three.js

- [Three.js Fundamentals](https://threejsfundamentals.org), especially:
  - [Basics](https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-fundamentals.html)
  - [Cameras](https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-cameras.html)
- Three.js [helpers](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=helpers) and
  [controls](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=controls)

### react-three-fiber

The basic thing to understand with R3F is that it's a **react reconciler**
(again, see
[Henschel's conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyqBdN71nFs)). This
basically means that it transforms JSX code to Three.js API calls. The available
mappings can be seen in these type declarations
[here](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber/blob/86b0f78d684ee9f25135f490b9159919cf486697/src/three-types.ts#L71-L298).

Further to this, the
[R3F GitHub repository](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) is
comprehensive.

## So You've Got Your 3D Spinner, But Now Your Performance Blows!

## Performance, Look at the Lighthouse Audit! Use this with React Intersection Observer FTW

**demo with lazy loading here**

<!-- <iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/mysterybear/blog-post-demos/tree/master/packages/3d-spinner-lazy?module=/pages/index.tsx" /> -->

Maybe mention **next.config.js** stuff

And that you then want to only show the loading spinner after some interaction
of course.

So best would be to use intersection observer to lazy load the container
component, and then regular conditional rendering inside that component as logic
for whether the 3D spinner is there or not
