When you sign up to the [bearjam.dev newsletter](/#newsletter-signup), you will
see a 3D loading spinner. Here it is in isolation:

We needed something to indicate the loading state during subscription, and I was
also keen to get my feet wet in the 3D web space, so... two birds one stone.

Looking at the
[react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) (R3F)
demos and how little code is needed to spin a box, it seems the ideal
entry-level 3D project (especially suiting our isometric cube logo!)

However, R3F is difficult to grok without having coded with Three.js. **I
strongly recommend starting Three.js code before porting to R3F** in order to
understand the underlying API.

Here are the resources that got me going with Three.js and R3F.

## Resources

### Three.js

- [Three.js Fundamentals](https://threejsfundamentals.org), especially:
  - [Basics](https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-fundamentals.html)
  - [Cameras](https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-cameras.html)
- Three.js [helpers](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=helpers) and
  [controls](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=controls)

### react-three-fiber

- [Bringing WebGL to React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyqBdN71nFs), a
  presentation by [Paul Henschel](https://twitter.com/0xca0a)
- The [R3F GitHub repository](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber)
  is full of documentation and examples.

The thing to understand about R3F is that it's a **react reconciler** (again,
see [Henschel's conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyqBdN71nFs)).
This means **it transforms JSX code to Three.js API calls**. The available
mappings can be seen in these
[type declarations](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber/blob/86b0f78d684ee9f25135f490b9159919cf486697/src/three-types.ts#L71-L298).

## Lazy Loading

If you run Lighthouse before and after including R3F in your code, you'll notice
a big performance hit (due to size of Three.js). This can be overcome with lazy
loading, which can be implemented in a
[variety of ways](https://web.dev/fast/#lazy-load-images-and-video).

In our case, it made sense to use a combination of
[dynamic imports](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#dynamic-imports)
and the
[Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).

There are some nice wrapper libaries such as
[@loadable/component](https://loadable-components.com/) and
[react-intersection-observer](https://github.com/thebuilder/react-intersection-observer).

Here is a CodeSandbox with lazy loading implemented:

_([Next.js ships its own dynamic import library](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import),
so we use that instead of
[@loadable/component](https://loadable-components.com/) for this demo. The API
is practically the same in either case.)_
