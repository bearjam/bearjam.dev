A website's navigation interface is a fundamental part of the user experience.
As a web developer or designer, you'll be creating headers, footers, sidebars,
etc. for most projects. You want to spend more time creating unique sites for
your clients, and less time re-implementing the same feature.

Let's get straight into it. Here's simpler version of the [bearjam.dev](/)
header. Play around and see how it behaves:

Now let's break it down into specific features and behaviours.

## Feature Requirements

- It's **responsive**: the header adapts to changes in screen size (try dragging
  the viewport across from the left).
- When the screen width is **above** the breakpoint (640px), the navigation
  links are displayed horizontally on the desktop header.
- When the screen width is **below** the breakpoint, **there is a toggle menu to
  expand/collapse the mobile header**.
- When the mobile header is expanded, there's a **staggered animation** to bring
  the links into view (and this effect is reversed upon collapse).
- **The active link indication is different between mobile and desktop**: on
  mobile, the active link text colour is blue. On desktop, the active link has a
  blue underline.
- When clicking the desktop header links, **the blue underline transitions
  between links**.

At first glance, the main problem appears to be figuring out all these
animations. Luckily, there's
[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/)[^1], which makes declaring
animations trivial.

The real issue is: how do we keep our code clean and reusable, abiding by
[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), as we work through
these requirements?

We identified two well-known patterns that fit well to bring all this together.

_Note: We use [Next](https://nextjs.org/) in the example code here. For
[bearjam.dev](/) we use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) which in turn uses
[Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router). You could also use
[React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)._

## #1 The Overlay Pattern

Taking elements out of flow to put them on top of others, using
[positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning),
is standard practice for web developers. But keeping things readable and easy to
reason about can get tricky when you've got lots of nested `div`'s. We found
that thinking explicitly in terms of "Root > Backdrop + Container" (to write in
selector form) really simplifies matters. Think of it this way:

```jsx
<Root animate={variant}>
  <Backdrop />
  <Container>{children}</Container>
</Root>
```

- `<Root />`'s responsibility is to cascade the animation state down through its
  children.
- The `<Backdrop />` is the expandable/collapsible pane; the underlay.
- The `<Container />` is where the rest of the content goes, e.g. your
  `<Nav />`('s).

Here's an example header component using this pattern:

```jsx
function Header() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  const toggleOpen = () => void setOpen(p => !p)
  return (
    <Root animate={open ? "open" : "closed"} initial="closed">
      <Backdrop
        variants={{
          closed: {
            y: `calc(-100% + ${theme.spacing[12]})`,
          },
          open: {
            y: 0,
          },
        }}
        transition={{
          type: "spring",
          damping: 25,
          mass: 0.9,
          stiffness: 120,
        }}
      />
      <Container>
        <MenuToggle onClick={toggleOpen} />
      </Container>
    </Root>
  )
}
```

Styled as follows:

```css
.backdrop {
  background-color: lightpink;
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  z-index: 10;
}

.container {
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: theme("spacing.12");
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  z-index: 20;
}

.container > * {
  padding: 0.5rem;
}
```

[Here's a CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/mysterybear/blog-post-demos/tree/master/packages/header-pattern-1?module=/pages/index.js).
Notice how simple it is to change a `<Header />` into a `<Sidebar />`. This
solves the first few [feature requirements](#feature-requirements) above.

## #2 The Render Props Pattern

Now the problem that remains: how can we re-use the underlying core of a
navigation component, whilst giving ourselves the freedom to customize how each
link is rendered?

This is a great time to leverage the
[render props pattern](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html). Before we
get into its implementation, let's look at how we call it:

<div class="lowlight">

```jsx{6-44,48-57}
<Container>
  <Branding />
  <MenuToggle onClick={toggleOpen} className={styles.menu} />
  <AnimatePresence>
    {open && (
      <Nav
        className={styles.navMobile}
        variants={{
          open: {
            transition: {
              staggerChildren: 0.3,
              delayChildren: 0.3,
            },
          },
          closed: {
            transition: {
              staggerChildren: 0.3,
              staggerDirection: -1,
            },
          },
        }}
        initial="closed"
        animate="open"
        exit="closed"
      >
        {({ href, label, active }) => (
          <motion.div
            initial="closed"
            variants={{
              open: {
                opacity: 1,
              },
              closed: {
                opacity: 0,
              },
            }}
            onClick={() => void setOpen(false)}
          >
            <Link href={href}>
              <a data-active={active}>{label}</a>
            </Link>
          </motion.div>
        )}
      </Nav>
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
  <AnimateSharedLayout>
    <Nav className={styles.navDesktop}>
      {({ href, label, active }) => (
        <Link href={href}>
          <a>
            <span>{label}</span>
            {active && <motion.div layoutId="underline" />}
          </a>
        </Link>
      )}
    </Nav>
  </AnimateSharedLayout>
</Container>
```

</div>

Notice how we pass a function as the child of each `<Nav />`. Magically:

- We have access to `href`, `label` and `active` as function input parameters.
- This function is mapped across all of our links.

The magic is abstracted away in the implementation of our `<Nav />`:

```jsx
export const Nav = ({ children, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <motion.nav {...props}>
      {links.map((linkProps, i) => (
        <NavLink
          key={linkProps.href}
          children={children}
          {...linkProps}
          i={i}
        />
      ))}
    </motion.nav>
  )
}

const NavLink = ({ children, href, label, i, ...props }) => {
  const { pathname } = useRouter()
  const pathBeginning = `/${pathname.split("/")[1]}`
  const active = pathBeginning === href
  return children ? (
    children({ href, label, active, ...props }, i)
  ) : (
    <Link key={href} href={href} {...props}>
      <a>{label}</a>
    </Link>
  )
}

const links = [
  { href: "/", label: "Page One" },
  { href: "/page-two", label: "Page Two" },
]
```

Notice how `<Nav />` passes our function (`children`) into the function mapping
over our links.

We also provide a default return in case `children` is undefined, allowing us to
just call `<Nav />` on its own without any children and still get a fully
functional navigation with links if we don't need any bells and whistles like
active link animations.
